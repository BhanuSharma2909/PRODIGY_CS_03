Here i have shared a python program to check the password complexity i.e. ( 1. Weak  2. Medium  3. Strong ) helps the user to generate a strong complex
password to avoid any security issue or data compromised.. A feedback option in this program helps the password generator user to use valid and strong attributes 
for password complexity such as Uppercase, lowercase, Alphanumeric character, password length should be minimum 8 character, must use special character etc.
